Coding Challenge - Tamondong:

There would be a total of 3 problems in this coding challenge. 
The first one would be "Palindome Pairs" where two words are concatenated and be checked whether or not they are a palindrome. 
The second problem would be "Valid Parentheses" where given an input of parentheses, the program will have to determine whether or not they are valid. 
Lastly, the third problem would be the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" where given an array of numbers, the program will have to determine the LIS. 
Each problem would have a more detailed explanation to it in their corresponding folder.


To access these problems, open the folder to the problem you wish to see. There, you would see 2 files, a "README.md" file and the java file.
